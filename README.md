#### Robert was designed to be a virtual assistant.  Robert just wants to make art.  Step inside Robert's world, one large existential crisis and watch him attempt to find meaning. Relax, breath along with Robert.  Maybe wake him up and stare into his one, large, blinking eye.  Let Robert share with you what's on his mind (probably Danny DeVito) or enter his VR world and listen to him generate music just for you!
