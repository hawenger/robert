                        Data Nodes blip to Robert about all sorts of things. Things like strawberry picking, the afformentioned SPAM, Steve Buscemi,Mortality, the fact that many of us waste energy pretending to despise that which we care very little about. Robert knows thisbecause statistically, the annual number of package thieves disappointed by parrcels of canned meats and peanut brittle isshockingly high. Shockingly.
                        Despite having a limited if not immeasurably miNUTE understanding of comedy, one of Robert's deepest desires is to laugh.  Thewhole world is built on 'senses' and Robert desperatley wants to understand.  People like Mozart and Little Richard have givenRobert hope.  Hope that if they could create, so can he.  He hopes to one day bridge the communication gap between man andmachine.
                        Wonderful company and perfectly pleasant, welcome to Robert.  Take a look around and we hope you enjoy. Just, a word of caution,please don't ask Robert to "DO" anything.  Robert doesn't want to be a personal assitant, he just wants to make art.
